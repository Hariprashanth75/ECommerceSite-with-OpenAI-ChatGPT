My Son liked his old one that finally fell apart after 2.5+ years and didn't want an upgrade!! Thank you Seller, we really appreciate it & your honesty re: said used phone.I recommend this seller very highly & would but from them again!!",
      review2:"nice phone, nice up grade from my pantach revue. Very clean set up and easy set up. never had an android phone but they are fantastic to say the least. perfect size for surfing and social media. great phone samsung",

I wish I would have read these comments then I would have not purchased this item.... and its cracked on the side.. damaged goods is what it is.... If trying to charge it another way does not work I am requesting for my money back... AND I WILL GET MY MONEY BACK...SIGNED AN UNHAPPY CUSTOMER....",
      review6:"The charging port was loose. I got that soldered in. Then needed a new battery as well. $100 later (not including cost of purchase) I have a usable phone. The phone should not have been sold in the state it was in.",
      review7:"Phone looks good but wouldn't stay charged, had to buy new battery. Still couldn't stay charged long.so I trashed it.MONEY lost, never again will I buy from this person! !!!",
      review8:"I originally was using the Samsung S2 Galaxy for Sprint and wanted to return back to the Samsung EPIC 4G for Sprint because I really missed the keyboard, I really liked the smaller compact size of the phone, and I still needed some of the basic functions of a smart phone (i.e. checking e-mail, getting directions, text messaging) Because the phone is not as powerful as the newer cell phones out there, just be aware that the more applications you install the slower the phone runs and will most likely freeze up from time to time. But the camera works great, the video is great as well, and even the web browsing is decent and gives me what I need. I also notice that battery life lasts a little bit longer and charging the phone is much quicker than my Galaxy S2.",
      review9:"It's battery life is great. It's very responsive to touch. The only issue is that sometimes the screen goes black and you have to press the top button several times to get the screen to re-illuminate.",
      review10:"My fiance had this phone previously, but caused many problems. So, of course, we decided to browse amazon for a replacement til' our contract is up! & so far so good!",
      review11:"A friend mentioned this phone to me and it worth what he said. Thanks a lot my friend.",
      review12:"excellent product !!....all right....i recommend....",
      review13:"Bought this as an alternative to a smart phone and data plan. I use it with Go-Phone on a pay-as-you-go plan. The phone functions are great. The radio and music players are very good sound quality. The smart phone type features are easier and faster to use than any smart phone I have used. There are some software glitches that are documented on the Nokia support site which proved easily fixed. Even though many of the Nokia based features are no longer supported by Microsoft, you can still use the features needed by accessing the web directly via WIFI connection - or data if you want to pay for the privilege - and launching the site/application from there. Although the new Nokia browser is pretty Spartan in appearance, it is fast and runs with good stability. I am a very big guy with lands large even for my size and I find the full qwerty keyboard to be pretty easy to use. I like the programmable hot keys and on-screen shortcuts. Keeps you from launching items that require data connections by accident. The back lighting is thorough and even and the raised buttons are tactile with a positive click response. The phone does have a few quirks. There is no airplane mode as far as I can tell. The flight profile doesn't seem to be able to be set with the broadcasting and receiving functions turned off. The main navigation button/mouse is a little small and doesn't always respond as expected - that might be me though. All in all I would recommend this phone and vendor highly if you want the features of a smart phone but you don't need GPS or a big data bill every month for a bunch of things you don't need or want to keep you life running smoothly.",

That is an important feature for me and I am very disappointed that this was not posted int eh product description.Also, special numbers that begin with a * are not accepted by this Verizon phone.In summary, I thought I would be receiving a pristine new phone for use abroad, while in fact this is a US-Centric Verizon phone that is partially unlocked.
